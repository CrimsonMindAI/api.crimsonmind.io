## API Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you need to include an API key in the request headers. The API key should be included as `x-api-key`.

### Request Headers

|-------------|------------------|
| x-api-key   | your_api_key     |

### Example Request

Here is an example of how to include the API key in your request headers using curl:

```sh
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/" -H "x-api-key: your_api_key"
